## Services:

* pgdb: This is the service definition for the PostgresSQL database. We're using the TimescaleDB image, which is a PostgreSQL database optimized for time-series data. This service maps the container's port 5432 to the host's port 5432 for external access.

* toughradius: This is the service definition for ToughRADIUS. This service depends on 'pgdb', meaning it will only start once 'pgdb' service is fully up and running. It uses the image 'ca17/toughradius:latest'.

## Port Mapping:

* "1816:1816": Web management port
* "1818:1818": FreeRADIUS API Service Port
* "1819:1819": TR069 Service port
* "2083:2083": Radsec service port
* "1812:1812/udp": RADIUS Authentication port, using UDP protocol
* "1813:1813/udp": RADIUS Accounting port, using UDP protocol

## Volumes:

* pgdb-volume: This volume is mounted to /var/lib/postgresql/data in the PostgresSQL database container, and it's used to store database data.
* toughradius-volume: This volume is mounted to /var/toughradius in the ToughRADIUS container, and it's used to store ToughRADIUS data.

##  Networks:

* toughradius_network: All the services are linked to this network, ensuring communication between containers.
* Environment variables are used to configure various parameters of ToughRADIUS, such as database connection information, log settings, etc.

Once you've created this Docker Compose file, you can use the docker-compose up command to start all services.
