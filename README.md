## System features

### TR069 ACS

TR069 ACS can provide real-time monitoring and maintenance of CPE devices in the network to ensure their normal operation. It supports multiple data models and allows custom Settings to accommodate different types of CPE devices. In addition, TR069 ACS also supports secure encryption to protect data privacy and security. Therefore, TR069 ACS not only improves the efficiency of network management, but also ensures network security.

- Configure or get device configuration parameters and operating status
- Provide vendor device configuration download
- Provide device factory reset configuration download
- Provide upgrade firmware download

### Radius Server

TOUGHRADIUS is a RADIUS server that supports the RADIUS protocol and the RADIUS over TLS (RadSec) protocol.

Standard RADIUS features

- Authentication message
- Authentication PAP authentication method
- Authentication CHAP authentication method
- Authentication MS-CHAPv2 authentication method
- Authorization message

  > After receiving the BAS Authentication request message, the RADIUS Server encapsulates the user authorization information according to the user information resources, and authorizes the user bandwidth limit, maximum duration, IP and other information to the BAS through the Authentication response message.

- Accounting-On message
- Accounting-Off message
- Accounting-Start message
- Accounting-Interium-Update message
- Accounting-Stop message
- Deliver the SessionTimeout attribute
- Deliver the AcctInterimInterval attribute
- Deliver the FramedPool attribute
- Deliver the FramedIPAddress attribute
- Deliver attributes of the customized vendor，such as Huawei, ZTE, Cisco，Mikrotik etc.

#### freeRADIUS integration
